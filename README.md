# Deep Learning Based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD)
This project is a part of my MTech thesis work, focusing on the development of an unsupervised reconstruction-based Video Anomaly Detection system using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Implementation of CNN-LSTM and 3D Convolution autoencoder models for video anomaly detection with **Tensorflow** library.
- Novel anomaly detection model leveraging image classifiers (Swin Transformer) for improved performance with **PyTorch** library.
- Codebase with easy-to-use functions and modular architecture.
- Pre-trained models for quick evaluation and deployment.
- Datasets and data preprocessing utilities for training and testing the models.
- Detailed documentation with instructions for setup, usage, and model evaluation.

More to come..
