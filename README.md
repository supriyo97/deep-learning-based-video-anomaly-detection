# deep-learning-based-video-anomaly-detection
This repository provides an implementation of deep learning based video anomaly detection (VAD) models, including traditional models such as CNN-LSTM-AE and C3D-AE, as well as a novel anomaly detection model based on the idea of using image classifiers for video anomaly detection. Find code, pre-trained models, datasets, and documentation.
